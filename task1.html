 Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem
Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older
brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.

 On 18 February 2006, Kohli made his debut in List A cricket, playing against Services in the Ranji
One-Day Trophy, but he did not have the opportunity to bat during the match.[ In 2006, Kohli had
garnered enough attention to earn a spot in the state senior team. Subsequently, he made his first-class
debut on 23 November 2006, during the opening match of the Ranji Trophy season against Tamil Nadu.
 </li>
 <li>
 In August 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri Lanka and the
Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had limited experience, with only eight
List A matches under his belt. So, his selection was considered a "surprise call-up".
